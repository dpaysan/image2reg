The setup of the computional environment was tested on the following systems:

System 1
--------
HP Z4 workstation
Ubuntu 20.04. LTS
Python v3.8
Intel(R) Xeon(R) W-2255 CPU with 3.70GHz
128GB RAM
Nvidia RTX 4000 GPU with CUDA v.11.1.74


System 2
---------
Thinkpad P1 mobile work station 
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
Python v3.8
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU with 2.60 GHz
32GB RAM and a Nvidia P2000 GPU w. CUDA 11.1.74




Note that the code was developed and all experiments were run using system 1.
System 2 was only used to validate and test the setup of the computional environment due to time constrains.
